Here, we periodically back up all the .mat files so that, in a pinch, you can
download the repo and quickly make all the figures without needing all the
software to do the computations. We also allow for backups of eps versions of
dia files to solve a custom shape portability issue.

To store backups in this folder, run `make matbackups` for the mat files and
`make diabackups` for the dia eps files. Note that this will require you to
have all the software to actually generate the mat files from scratch and all
the custom shapes to export the dia files to eps.

By default, make will use the backed up copies of mat files and generate the
dia eps files from scratch. To change this behavior, create a file called
"Makefile.options" and add one of the following lines:

    USE_MAT_BACKUPS=False
    USE_DIA_BACKUPS=True

You can set either of the options to True or False as you please; True uses
the corresponding backup files, whils False builds from scratch.
