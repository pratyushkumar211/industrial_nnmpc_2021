This folder is for script files used during automated building. Individual repos
should typically not have to add/change anything in this folder.

Note that the scripts domatplotlib.py, dopython.py, and INSTALL.py are designed
to be run via Python 2 or Python 3, as chosen with the PYTHON variable in the
Makefile. The other scripts always run with Python 3 (and thus have execute
permissions and a python3 shebang).
