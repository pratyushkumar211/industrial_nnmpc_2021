This folder is for "library" code, i.e., Python or Octave code that is specific
to the repo but is called multiple times. This is distinct from the script
folder that contains build-related scripts that are the same for each repo. The
main reason for breaking this out is so we can ignore *.pyc files here, and also
to aid in autodependency generation.

Note that each repo should have a custompath.py module here to allow users to
specify any external code that may need to be called. Similarly, custompath.m
provides this functionality to Octave/Matlab scripts.

By default, this directory is added to the Octave and Python paths, while script
is not. If you want some other behavior, then that needs to be hard-coded in the
source files, or enforced by editing the makefile.
