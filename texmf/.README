This folder is used for any special packages or style files to be used in the
main document. When make is run, all files in this directory (except for this
README) are symbolically linked to so that they can be found by pdflatex.

We put these files in this subfolder because typically they won't change much
after being added initially, and so they can be easily grabbed by make using
a wildcard.

Note that I have also decided to put any unsourced figures (i.e. pdfs without
make rules, possibly stolen from my other presentations) here as well, since
they should be handled basically exactly like these files.
