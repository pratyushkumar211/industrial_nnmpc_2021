This repository contains code for the paper: 

"Industrial, large-scale model predictive control with structured neural
networks" 
Pratyush Kumar, James B. Rawlings, and Stephen J. Wright

published in Computers and Chemical Engineering, 2021.

The following python scripts can be run in sequence to generate the results and
plots. "ex" is the name of the example, either "cstrs" or "cdu".

1. ex_parameters.py 
2. ex_mpc.py 
3. ex_us.py 
4. ex_satdlqr.py
5. ex_short_horizon.py
6. ex_offline_data.py num_parallel
7. ex_offline_data_post_processing.py
8. ex_train.py num_parallel
9. ex_train_post_processing.py
10. ex_neural_network.py
11. ex_comparision_plots.py 

For the simulations presented in the paper, the scripts were run on a computing
cluster for both the CSTRs and crude distillation unit examples. The structured
neural network architecture is available in lib/LinearMPCLayers.py. The call
function in the classes "RegulatorLayerWithUprev" and
"RegulatorLayerWithoutUprev" shows how to smybolically make predictions with the
structured architecture.
