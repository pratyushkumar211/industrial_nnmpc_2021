This folder is for all pdf files created while building the main document. We
use this subfolder just to keep the build directory slightly organized, and
also to make it easy to find all of the figure files (which often need to be
inspected manually) without having to wade through the mess that is the build
folder.

The only pdfs that should end up here are the (non-matplotlib) ones that don't
have separate version for paper, poster, and presentation. This includes, e.g.
Octave/Gnuplot figures that still happen to be floating around. dia things
should also end up in this folder. Note that I have gotten rid of support for
greyscale dia until I figure out a better way to handle it.
